# Machine-Learning

As part of the Master's program in Data Science and Engineering, together with two colleagues, we carried out machine learning projects that involved creating models for image classification, predicting cyberattacks, forecasting tire wear in F1 cars, and predicting stock prices using time series analysis. The projects included data collection and processing (EDA), model training, validation, and testing.
